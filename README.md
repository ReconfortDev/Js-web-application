# Build Tools App

## Description
A simple web application displaying a list of popular build tools using Webpack, ES6+, Sass, and Lodash.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Create a production build: `npm run build`

## Available npm Scripts
- `start`: Starts the development server with Webpack Dev Server.
- `build`: Creates a production build.
- `lint`: Runs ESLint for linting.
- `test`: Runs Jest tests.

## Build Process
Webpack bundles the JavaScript and Sass files, while Babel transpiles ES6+ JavaScript to be compatible with older browsers. Production builds are optimized and minified, with code splitting implemented for external libraries.
